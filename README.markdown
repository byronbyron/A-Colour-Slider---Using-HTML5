#A Colour Slider - Using HTML5#

A simple app to help you find the colour value you want.

This little app mainly exists because I wanted to create something using the HTML5 API, a handful of Javascript and a little bit of CSS.

Simply use the sliders to adjust the colour of the heading to your liking. Then, just like magic, the CSS code is updated to reflect the colour value.

It should work in all the modern browsers.

##Possible Improvement Ideas##

* Support for all browsers &#x2713;
* Update value using a text field
* Support for other colour inputs (hexadecimal)
